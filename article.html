                    <h2>
                        
                         More than 100 years ago, Seattle-based Brooks Running actually made ice skates. While there’s 
                        no intention of getting back into that line of business, the company is announcing a new partnership with the
                        Seattle Kraken as official supplier of off-ice footwear and apparel for the NHL franchise.
                        In the multi-year deal — terms of which were not disclosed — Brooks replaces Adidas in outfitting Kraken players, 
                        coaches and staff for their training needs. Brooks will also support the team as needed through the high-tech Run 
                        Research Lab that it operates at its headquarters building on the north end of Lake Union.
                        
                        <br/> <br/>

                        On Wednesday, Kraken goalie Joey Daccord, who will serve as a player ambassador in the partnership, was put 
                        through the paces on a treadmill in the lab. An avid runner and longtime Brooks customer now in his sixth NHL season, 
                        Daccord helped demonstrate how biomechanics and athlete insights are used to not only inform the development of products, 
                        but also aid in training efficiency and injury reduction.
                        
                        <br/> <br/>

                        A team of about 25 Brooks employees works in the lab, where infrared motion-capture cameras ring
                        the ceiling and assess athlete movement via small sensors stuck to various points on the athlete’s body.
                        At one point, Daccord jogged at a steady pace for about two minutes while wearing a metabolic mask to test
                        his VO2 max capacities.

                        <br/> <br/>

                        Pete Humphrey, head of research and development at Brooks, said everything at Brooks has 
                        to be grounded in science with the goal of making athletes better and helping them enjoy the run.
                        
                        <br/> <br/>

                        “In the beginning, we had a little insole we put in a shoe. The lab was located in the same
                        room with our printer/copier machine,” Humphrey said. “We’ve grown it into what is today one of the
                        one of the most state-of-the-art facilities. This is the foundation of all product we build.”

                        The treadmills in the lab are running about 300 days out of the year, sometimes with high-level athletes
                        like Daccord or members of the Brooks professional team, or with ordinary runners and walkers. Each product 
                        goes through anywhere from three to seven iterations, depending on the innovation involved.
                        
                        <br/> <br/>

                        Data coming off the treadmill might help engineer a shoe midsole so that it works best with an athlete’s body.
                        Cushioning, energy, return, release, and support information is all used to build a shoe from the athlete up,
                        versus just putting a shoe on a runner and hoping it works.

                        “It’s all about the athlete from start to end,” said Jennifer Sumner, director of run research at Brooks.
                        “That’s going to be understanding how they’re moving from the outside, and then what’s actually happening 
                        inside their body as well.”

                        Following the demonstration with Daccord in the lab, Brooks and the Kraken held a post-game “press conference”
                        higher up in the HQ building. Joined by more than 100 Brooks employees, Brooks CEO Dan Sheridan and Kraken CEO
                        Tod Leiweke discussed their appreciation for each others’ brand and their excitement about working together and
                        serving the community.
                        
                        <br/> <br/>

                        Sheridan, who has been at Brooks since 1998, assumed the CEO role six months ago, succeeding Jim Weber, who spent
                        more than 20 years in the top job.

                        Leiweke, a lifelong runner with seven marathons and a few Mount Rainier climbs under his belt, said he was looking
                        forward to wearing his Brooks gear at Kraken games.
                        
                        <br/> <br/>

                        “We get to wear not just a shoe we believe is trustworthy and all of those things, it’s a shoe we’re proud of,
                        because you have a culture here that is so unique and so special,” Leiweke said.

                        Started in 1914 in Philadelphia, Brooks is the oldest American sporting goods company in the U.S. The company made
                        its move to the Northwest in 1993 and to its current location along the Burke-Gilman Trail on the Fremont-Wallingford
                        border 10 years ago. The company now employs 550 people in Seattle and 1,400 worldwide, and will occupy part of a
                        second building being built next door.
                        
                        <br/> <br/>
                        
                        A subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway, Brooks reported record revenue in the second quarter, up 15% year-over-year.
                        It has the highest market share in the adult performance running footwear market for U.S. retail. The company
                        said its e-commerce revenue grew 22% year-over-year in the first quarter.
                        
                        <br/> <br/>

                        Brooks-Kraken-branded gear will eventually make its way into team pro shops for fans to purchase. And Brooks
                        branding will also show up in Climate Pledge Arena and during televised games, via digital displays.

                        So why pair a longtime running brand and a 3-year-old pro hockey team?

                        “Run is at the center of every performance athlete’s training — doesn’t matter what sport you’re in,” 
                        Sheridan said. “What we know as a universal truth is that athletes choose to run for their training, and 
                        the biggest fear that an athlete has is injury. So we spend every waking hour on the biomechanics of human
                        motion, the kinesiology and physiology of how to make a run better for the athletes.”

                    <h2>
                        To foster a healthy shift in employee comfort levels with generative AI, the Spurs are currently leading an
                        internal pilot program with various learning opportunities using OpenAI’s ChatGPT.
                        
                        <br/> <br/>

                        Spurs Sports & Entertainment Director of Innovation and Strategy Charlie Kurian told SBJ that 150 employees are
                        taking part in the program, which started in October along with the team’s yearlong ChatGPT Enterprise contract.
                        Kurian added that the Spurs have taken a “human-centered lens” to this program after finding that two-thirds of 
                        surveyed employees said they were interested in using GenAI but “a very small percentage” actually used it.
                        
                        <br/> <br/>

                        “Rather than ‘Hey, let’s figure out the best use cases and go chase the use cases,’ we looked broadly,” Kurian said.
                        “How do we change the culture and enable people to work in this space?”
                       
                        <br/> <br/>

                        The program is catering to both frequent and first-time users, Kurian said. The Spurs have worked with OpenAI to 
                        create structured learning modules, holding different sessions that range from intros to ChatGPT and large-language
                        modules to building custom GPTs.
                        
                        <br/> <br/>

                        Kurian said that more than 50% of pilot users are active, and on top of the 150 participants, another 50-to-60 
                        employees are currently waitlisted for ChatGPT usage. The Spurs are planning an in-house demo day in March to 
                        showcase some of the most creative use cases with GenAI. “Culturally, it’s been great,” Kurian said. “And I think 
                        that's because we alleviated the pressure that we need to arrive somewhere with it today.”
                        
                        <br/> <br/>

                        <div class="highlight">Unique use cases from the pilot so far</div>

                        <br/> 

                        One early use case that stands out from the program’s first six weeks is the creation of a custom GPT called Spurs
                        Legacy. Kurian said the GPT came from repurposing the 50-part docuseries the franchise created in honor of its 50th
                        year (the 2022-23 season). The Spurs used the GPT to transcribe every installment of the series and created a team
                        culture expert that can provide long-term context to fan questions.
                       
                        <br/> <br/>

                        Kurian also added that the merchandise team used ChatGPT to suggest user interface changes for one of their websites
                        – using the tool to also generate HTML code to make those changes. That website project, Kurian said, had been a
                        multi-year process now boiled down to roughly 15 minutes.
                        
                        <br/> <br/>

                        These two examples point to the larger goal that Kurian sees with this – using ChatGPT to create different
                        problem-solving thought processes.
                        
                        <br/> <br/>

                        “I think our industry is so cyclical, and for the right reasons: we're very busy,” Kurian said. “... There is very
                        little time for people to be heads up. And I think giving the space to be able to spark curiosity here is something
                        that -- forget about the efficiencies and all -- I think it's a great opportunity to be able to upskill and create
                        opportunity for our organization.”

                        The Spurs’ usage of GenAI started in 2018, Kurian said, through relationships with Conversica (provider of marketing,
                        sales and customer service digital agents) and Satisfi Labs (front-facing information assistants).

                        “We knew how transformational it was, but at the same time, our organization has always had the mindset of not having
                        the perfect answer, but just let's go test and learn,” Kurian said.
                        
                        <br/> <br/>
                       
                        When ChatGPT launched in late 2022, the Spurs rolled out a feature called FanGPT, which was presented as standalone 
                        kiosks in Frost Bank Center where fans could ask questions about the amenities there. The team rolled out this activation,
                        Kurian said, because fan feedback revealed a difficulty in navigating the concourse. What did the Spurs learn from that?
                        Fans didn’t enjoy the kiosk experience.
                        
                        <br/> <br/>
                       
                        “They just didn’t care about it,” Kurian said. “To be better said, the learning was that when fans have paid so much money
                        to come watch the games, they’re not looking to stand at a kiosk and talk to a screen.”
                        
                        <br/> <br/>
                        
                        This eventually led to a more recent rollout called Arena Navigator, a team app and web portal developed with Fresh Labs 
                        for fans to maneuver around the three-level venue. That evolution encapsulates the Spurs approach around tech and GenAI:
                        Kurian pointed to it as a willingness to test and learn.
                        
                        <br/> <br/>
                        
                        “I think our organization will continue to double down here very deeply,” Kurian said of GenAI. “I have one of our teams 
                        that is actually figuring out a way to make this accessible for all of the staff that are not even part of the pilot 
                        program.

                        “So there's been a natural leaning-in here while bringing people along and creating every opportunity for people that
                        might not feel the same way.”

                    <h2>
                        Microsoft’s AI for Good Lab this morning unveiled a new open-source project and AI-powered edge computing
                        device designed to improve biodiversity monitoring, with the goal of helping outside researchers better
                        understand the planet.
                        
                        <br/> <br/>
                        
                        It’s called Project SPARROW, for Solar-Powered Acoustic and Remote Recording Observation Watch. It’s
                        the first project of its kind from the lab, which is part of Microsoft Philanthropies, separate from 
                        the company’s product groups.

                        <br/> <br/>
                        
                        The project includes blueprints for a solar-powered device equipped with advanced sensors, including camera
                        traps and acoustic monitors. Microsoft says this enables SPARROW to operate autonomously with minimal
                        environmental impact. Researchers will be able to reprogram the devices remotely, for example.

                        <br/> <br/>
                      
                        Microsoft says it will open-source all aspects of SPARROW, including software, hardware plans, and 3D-printable
                        designs, so researchers, NGOs and scientists can build, deploy, and adapt their own SPARROW devices.
                       
                        <br/> <br/>
                       
                        SPARROW uses onboard AI to filter data collected from sensors like cameras and acoustic monitors. Only 
                        essential data will be transmitted via satellite, preserving bandwidth and energy consumed by those transmissions.

                        “If this works, and I hope it will, and it gets adopted, it will change the way [scientists] work,” said Juan
                        Lavista Ferres, the chief scientist and director of the AI for Good Lab, in an interview this week. “Suddenly,
                        you will have all these sensors across the world, and they will be able to understand how is the world changing.”

                        In addition to making the project open-source, he said, Microsoft will ensure that the data is owned by the
                        participating researchers, not by the company. At the same time, Microsoft is encouraging researchers to share
                        the data collected on SPARROW devices with others, and it’s offering to help them create and distribute open
                        data sets.

                        He said the project is an outgrowth of more than five years of work between the AI for Good Lab and researchers
                        who collect and analyze data about endangered wildlife and ecosystems around the world.

                        Previously, Microsoft was helping largely with the analysis, but it realized that the collection could also
                        benefit from technology.
                        
                        <br/> <br/>
                        
                        Microsoft plans to deploy its own initial SPARROW devices to sites in North and South America over the next
                        few months, to test and refine the solution. Its goal is to have devices on every continent by the end of 2025.

                    <h2>
                        Virtual reality (VR) has grown enormously in importance in recent years and is increasingly being used
                        in various areas of our society, including education, medicine, the military and entertainment. Experts
                        see a particularly promising field of application in the training of athletes. To what extent does the
                        future of training and competition preparation lie in virtual reality? Can the efficient use of VR even
                        make the decisive difference in the end?

                        <br/><br/>

                        To make one thing clear in advance. Talent and perseverance in training cannot be replaced by the use of virtual 
                        reality. Endurance athletes will need to train many hours a week to improve their maximum oxygen capacity or anaerobic
                        endurance capacity. Similarly, training on the ball is essential for professional footballers; for gymnasts, 
                        it is the uneven or balance beam. The use of VR in training is generally intended as a supplementary tool. Virtual
                        reality training enables athletes to develop, improve or even perfect skills in a controlled and realistic environment.
                        This has many advantages.

                                Realistic simulations:
                                VR allows athletes to simulate realistic training situations without the risk of injury or fatigue.
                                For example, soccer players can play through various game scenarios in a virtual environment, test 
                                their decisions under pressure and analyze the tactics of their opponents. Tennis players, on the other
                                hand, can practise their serves and returns. Such simulation-based training methods help to improve technical
                                skills and optimize reaction times.

                                In VR, specific game situations can be repeated as often as required. This is particularly useful for
                                refining certain techniques.

                                Tactical analysis and match preparation:
                                Coaches can record game scenes and re-enact them in a virtual environment to give athletes a better
                                understanding of their opponent's strategies. This type of analysis helps athletes to better prepare 
                                for upcoming matches and refine their own style of play.

                                Analyzing performance:
                                VR systems can collect data on athletes' movements and reactions, which can then be used to analyze
                                performance. These analyses help coaches to provide targeted feedback and optimize training plans.

                                Mental training:
                                VR tools offer athletes* the opportunity to train their concentration and stress management in simulated
                                competition situations. By replicating the pressure of competition, athletes can learn to deal with
                                nervousness and distractions.
                                <br/>
                                This is particularly important in sports such as tennis, golf or shooting, where the mental aspect often
                                makes the difference between winning and losing.
                            </li>

                                Rehabilitation after injuries:
                                Tailored VR programs allow athletes* to improve their movement and strength while training their balance
                                and coordination without having to overexert themselves physically. This not only helps in rehabilitation,
                                but also in preventing future injuries. So much for the theory. But in fact, new training opportunities
                                have opened up for many athletes in practice. Compared to conventional computer screens, VR technology
                                enables much greater immersion in the virtual environment. The separation from the real world and
                                high-fidelity software lead to a much more intense and physical experience compared to simply "viewing"
                                video and application content on a conventional screen.

                        VR is already part of training practice at the Austrian Ski Association. Ski racers use VR goggles to relive and
                        analyze races they have already completed or to prepare and practice for upcoming races. That's smart, because
                        every downhill run holds
                        ski racers* a certain risk of injury. This use of VR also saves resources. This small example alone shows the
                        potential of this technology.
                        
                        <br/><br/>
                       
                        A few years ago, VR glasses were used in a study at Bishop's University to improve decision-making in young
                        basketball players. Participants were shown videos of set plays and had to decide which action they would take next at the end of the clip. Players who had watched the videos in VR made significantly better decisions on the court than those who had only watched the moves on conventional screens.
                        
                        <br/><br/>
                        
                        The DFB Academy also identified improved decision-making as a use case in a two-year project with the U16
                        juniors. By creating a 360° world with images from a real game, the players are supposed to concentrate on
                        the preliminary orientation. Although they have to physically look around, they don't have to move in any other
                        way, so the training is very low-impact. Toni Kroos was a master of pre-orientation during his active
                        career, as he knew where to pass the ball at all times. An important skill for professional footballers who
                        want to be among the world's best.
                        
                        <br/><br/>
                        
                        Especially in sports such as soccer, where making the right decisions is of great importance, VR can be
                        used to explore all decision-making options with the help of artificial intelligence (AI). Here you can
                        experiment with different passing or running decisions to find out how they would have changed the outcome
                        of the respective game scenario. AI algorithms could use the information about the time before the decision
                        was made to simulate what would probably have happened with any other possible decision. Highly complex, highly
                        technical and highly exciting.

                        Individual sports have also long since picked up the ball. Mischa Zverev, former professional tennis player,
                        manager and brother of Alexander Zverev, reports on the methods and effectiveness of VR training in tennis.
                        "We focused on a combination of VR glasses and practice-oriented neuroathletic exercises. We quickly realized
                        the effectiveness felt the effectiveness. Basically, the aim is to improve the movement patterns of a body 
                        that are not possible with conventional training methods. The great opportunity of the virtual exercises 
                        with the glasses is that they are playful and we can use the data collected to make the exercises sustainable,"
                        says Mischa Zverev.
                        His brother Alexander Zverev has just won the Masters in Paris and is now ranked number two in the world.
                        For Alexander Zverev, neuroathletics and coach Lars Lienhard are an important part of his success. 
                        Neuroathletics training with VR glasses has several advantages for Alexander Zverev. Firstly, it allows him
                        to train automatisms, which are particularly important in tennis. On the other hand, VR training also has a
                        very practical advantage when it comes to training with individual coach Lienhard: "Lars only exists once in
                        the world and whether you're in New York or Australia, he can't always be in the same place. With the VR glasses,
                        I can still train with him."
                        
                        <br/><br/>
                        
                        Alexander Zverev is working together with IMPROVR. The Munich-based company specializes in athlete training
                        with VR and relies on software that is primarily designed to improve cognitive skills. The two Zverev brothers
                        will give more insights into this at ISPO Munich 2024, where they will be guests on December 4 and explain
                        how to "train intelligently" these days.

                        <div class="highlight">Not everything that is possible virtually is good in real life </div>

                        <br/>
        
                        Despite all the possible applications and potential advantages over conventional training methods using video,
                        VR training should not be overused. Sessions longer than 30 minutes can cause nausea or headaches, known 
                        as cybersickness. This often happens when there is a mismatch between what viewers see and what is reported 
                        back to the brain via the sense of balance in the inner ear. Even though the hardware is generally becoming
                        more affordable and lighter, current VR glasses currently weigh between 500 and 600 grams. This can lead
                        to discomfort during longer training sessions as it puts too much strain on the athlete's neck muscles.
                        This can be counterproductive, especially when it comes to training automatisms.

                        <br/><br/>

                        Experts currently also advise against using VR to train fine motor skills. A lack of haptic feedback 
                        and imperfect "pseudeo" realism can lead to movement patterns being rehearsed incorrectly. Mischa Zverev 
                        also knows that training with VR must always be reviewed and that its use and development is only just 
                        beginning: "It should always be seen as a supplementary training tool. VR certainly doesn't replace existing 
                        training! But it can be used to train movement patterns of the body that cannot be achieved with conventional 
                        training methods." However, the handling and use of VR training must be viewed with caution. "Neuro-centered 
                        training and VR technology are two new, modern components that need to be combined. In the end, it all comes 
                        down to the effectiveness for the athlete. And we are constantly working on this," says Mischa Zverev.
                        
                        <br/><br/>

                        <br/>

                        It is difficult to say where the limits of VR training lie. What is certain is that not all areas of application
                        have been exhausted. There are speculations that VR developers may also consider the use of bodysuits and
                        sports equipment with tracking functions.
                        This could pave the way for a realistic sports experience in a virtual environment. If the developers then
                        manage to implement vibrations in the hardware, this could potentially become a game changer. Bobsleighing
                        through the ice channel without being there yourself. A very smart idea.
                        
                        <br/><br/>
                        
                        It is to be expected that mixed reality via VR goggles will also find more interest and application in the
                        future. A 100-metre sprinter, for example, could virtually create an Olympic stadium on the training ground
                        to simulate the most important competition of the year in her daily training. Full stands, cheering spectators
                        - everything as close to reality as possible. Imagined scenarios and processes can be played out and serve as
                        mental replays of possible real events. Dealing with performance pressure and fears before the competition, 
                        practising routines, stress management and emotion regulation - sports psychologists are already adjusting 
                        their glasses. VR training as a game changer? The potential is there and it's real.

                        While not a new invention, electric bicycles have only recently become more of a household name.
                        E-bikes are increasing in popularity for good reason, but there are a lot of people who have understandable
                        reservations. When you grow up riding something as standard as a classic Schwinn bike, trying an electric
                        bike can feel somewhere in between exciting and nerve-wracking. But do not fear! Our blog is coming in hot

                        Rest assured, riding one of Schwinn’s e-bikes will quickly feel just as second nature as riding the
                        traditional (or analog) bike you’re used to. In fact, we’re pretty sure you’ll end up preferring it to 
                        your old bicycle.

                            Keep in mind, you can ride a Schwinn e-bike without any power at all, just like you would an analog bike. But, 
                            that won’t give you the true electric bike experience!

                            Your e-bike comes with a battery, a charger, and a charging cord. Plug the cord into the charger, then plug 
                            it into the battery and, finally, plug it into the wall. The battery can be charged while it is on the bike, or 
                            you can remove it to charge the battery in a different location, like your office after commuting to work. A 
                            light located on the battery will turn on to let you know that it’s charging properly.

                            The Pedal Assist System, or PAS, is a feature of your e-bike that provides extra power behind each pedal.
                            It all runs through the LCD display located on the handlebars, from here you can toggle between one of 7 
                            levels of assistance and turn on the PAS. Once you turn it on, the system engages each time you pedal on the
                            electric bike. If you don’t press the power button to turn on the PAS, it will feel like you’re riding a 
                            regular bike when you pedal.

                            While your e-bike battery is charging, take a moment to study up on the PAS. A couple things to review:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Find the power button to turn on the display</li>

                            </ul>
                            A Schwinn e-bike only activates extra power when you pedal and when a PAS level is turned on.

                            Prepare for your e-bike ride as you would for any other: put your helmet on, check your brakes 
                            and seat height, and run through the regular pre-ride checklist.

                            Once you get on your e-bike, hold down the power button for 2 seconds to turn it on. Press the 
                            up arrow to choose the level of pedal assist you want. It’s perfectly fine to start low. You can

                            You’ll immediately feel a little extra “push” while pedaling with the PAS activated. Test it 
                            out a little — stop pedaling and you’ll immediately feel that “push” wear off. Do this until 
                            you feel comfortable to take your e-bike for a longer ride!

                        Riding around on electric bikes might feel a little surprising at first, but most people who try 
                        it love it. One of the reasons it’s not scary (and not all that different from riding an analog bike) 
                        is that you can turn off the pedal assist at any time, and that as soon as you stop pedaling, you lose 
                        that extra power.

                        <div class="highlight">Do I have to brake differently on an e-bike?</div>
                                                
                        You can brake the same on an electric bike as you would on any other bicycle. Some e-bikes come with 
                        disc brakes which have extra stopping power, so you might not have to brake as hard. However, the method 
                        of braking is exactly the same. And, since you brake while coasting (not pedaling), there isn’t any 
                        extra power that would affect your braking.

                        <div class="highlight">What’s the difference between the throttle and the Pedal Assist System?</div>


                        The main difference between the throttle and the Pedal Assist System is the force that is responsible 
                        for moving the bike forward. With the throttle, the electric bike will accelerate under its own power 
                        and does not require any pedaling to get going. This is accomplished with the hub drive motor on the 
                        bike. Now, with the Pedal Assist System, the force responsible for going forward is you pedaling. The 
                        motor still comes into play here and provides some assistance by giving an extra boost each time you 
                        pedal. Using PAS, the bike will not accelerate without use of the pedals like the throttle does.

                        To sum it all up…

                        <br/>

                        Just like we went from pushcarts to wagons and from wagons to cars, the evolution of the bicycle 
                        is ultimately an exciting advancement. Riding an e-bike is a natural progression from riding an 
                        analog bike — trust us, you’ll love it!

                    <h2>
                        The Pit Boost concept which will require Formula E drivers to make a mandatory pitstop is set to 
                        be implemented during races in the upcoming 2024/25 season, Autosport understands.
                        
                        <br/><br/>

                        The technology, which means the new Gen3 Evo cars will receive a 10% battery recharge at 600kW 
                        that will take approximately 30 seconds, has finally been given the green light after being in 
                        development for the last two seasons.

                        <br/><br/>
                        
                        Initially touted for the beginning of the Gen3 era in 2022, reliability and safety concerns 
                        meant it has taken until now for the FIA and Formula E organisers to be satisfied and allow it 
                        to be used during competition.

                        <br/><br/>
                        
                        The concept was tested for the first time during a race at pre-season testing last month in Spain,
                        with the data from that simulation outing analysed by the championship and governing body.

                        <br/><br/>
                        
                        Autosport understands that the concept has been given the go-ahead and will be implemented on 
                        double-header weekends in order to vary strategies between each race at the same location.

                        <br/><br/>
                        
                        Its first appearance is therefore set to come in Jeddah on a truncated version of the layout 
                        used by Formula 1 on 14-15 February and will feature at further rounds including Monaco, Tokyo, 
                        Shanghai, Berlin and London.

                        While Pit Boost is already part of the current sporting regulations, Autosport understands that a 
                        tweak will be made to those regulations following a meeting of the FIA’s World Motor Sport Council 
                        next week regarding how Attack Mode is used in conjunction with the new technology.

                        <br/><br/>
                        
                        Alongside the 350kW of extra power from Attack Mode, which this year will activate all-wheel-drive, 
                        the introduction of Pit Boost is set to add another strategic element to races but one which some 
                        drivers are wary of in the event of a poorly timed safety car.

                        <br/><br/>
                        
                        Ahead of this weekend's Sao Paulo season-opener, reigning champion Pascal Wehrlein warned: “We are 
                        not allowed to box everyone at the same time, it's always one car per team.

                        <br/><br/>
                        
                        "Half of the field, so 11 cars, are boxing on lap 15 and the other half is maybe boxing on lap 18, 
                        but between those laps there's a safety car. It's a huge advantage for the second group.

                        <br/><br/>
                        
                        “It's not like there's maybe one guy who would benefit or two guys, it could well be that you could 
                        end up from being in P1 completely out of the points, just because there was an unfair situation with a safety car.”
